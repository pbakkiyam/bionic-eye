PROBLEM STATEMENT:
     In the world there are 285 million peoples are visually impaired and 39 million peoples are completely blind.
Due to optical damage of retina, retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. So, the people can’t be able to see this world.
SOLUTION:
     Bionic Eye is an emerging revolutionary technique enabling blind   individuals to see, achieved through visual implants like cameras or photoreceptor arrays.
The device captures images using a camera, converts them into electrical signals, and stimulates the remaining healthy parts of the visual pathway.
The implantable visual prosthesis relies on a small chip placed behind the retina at the back of the eyeball.
Virtual prostheses such as automated retinal systems offer innovative solutions for severe vision impairment care.

BIONIC EYE:
     BIONIC EYE is an experimental visual device intended to restore functional vision in those suffering blindness.
Electronic device which replaces the functionality of a part or whole of the eye.

Bionic Eye device is developed to restore a sense of vision to people with retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.

HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS:

WORKING MODEL:
The Bionic version system consists of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses, which transmits high frequency radio signals to a microchip implanted in the eye.
Electrodes on the implanted chip convert these signals into electrical impulses to stimulate cells in the retina that connect to the optic nerve.
These impulses are then passed down along the optic nerve to the vision processing centre of the brain, where they are interpreted as an image.

ARTIFICIAL SILICON PROSTHESIS:
Artificial retina prosthesis is done using ‘ARTIFICIAL SILICON RETINA’ 
It contains approximately 3500 microscopic solar cells called “micro photodiodes”, each having its own stimulating electrodes.
Artificial silicon retina is a solid-state biocompatible chip which contains an array of photoreceptors and is implanted to replace the functionality of defective photoreceptors.
It detects light and converts into electric impulses.
